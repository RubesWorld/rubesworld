### What's up!
I made my way into the Technology industry via Sales, selling software engineering services to 100s of founders, Agency CEOs and VPs of Engineering. I was constantly longing to be on the other side building awesome products and finally made the plunge to Full-Stack Engineering, via Lambda School's Full-Stack Program. I am currently a Demo Engineer at a Unicorn SaaS company working on streamlining and optimizing our Sales Team's demo environment. 

Being able to take something from idea to live application is one of the most fulfilling feelings I've ever felt. I am very comfortable with aspects of the entire product lifecycle. These include: 
- idea validation
- creating user flows 
- wire framing, high-fidelity designs & prototyping
- Database Design 
- Relational and non-relational database development
- RESTful API creation
- Unit and Integration Testing 

I enjoy talking to teammates and stakeholders alike, no matter their level, and ensuring communication is efficient, comfortable and strong. I envision myself contributing to the team on day one.
