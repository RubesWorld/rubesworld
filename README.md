### What's up!
I made my way into the Technology industry via Sales, selling software engineering services to 100s of founders, Agency CEOs and VPs of Engineering. I was constantly longing to be on the other side building awesome products and finally made the plunge to Full-Stack Engineering, via Lambda School's Full-Stack Program.
